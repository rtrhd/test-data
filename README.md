# test-data
This is a home for test data for ICA-AROMA and other tools, where the image data, either as DICOM or as nifti files
would bloat the source repository of the project unacceptably.
It is organised by project and is generally in the form of bzipped tarballs.
There are no restrictions on the use of the data.
